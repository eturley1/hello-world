Just another repository

My name is Elizabeth Turley. I am an undergraduate journalism student at Hofstra University on Long Island, looking to broaden my multimedia skills in the fields of web, print and broadcast journalism. You can find my work in The Hofstra Chronicle, HEATâ€™s Hofstra Today, and the Journal Inquirer. I love dogs, dancing and data.
